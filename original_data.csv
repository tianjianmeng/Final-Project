4,Dr Sharib Ali,"I obtained my PhD in image analysis (awarded in 01/2016) from the University of Lorraine from CNRS - CRAN laboratory at Nancy, France, where I was involved in the development of robust computer vision algorithms for monitoring bladder cancer progression by accurately creating mosaics of endoscopic videos. The key element in this work was to enable computer to match reliable features based on frame motion and perform mosaicking of the surface under observation (Thesis here). I did my master’s by research in Computer Vision from University of Burgundy, France (2010-2012). My master’s thesis was on “Retinal image analysis from fundus imaging”, which was a collaborative project between Oak Ridge National Laboratory, USA and Le2I, Le Creusot at the University of Bourgogne. Prior to joining Leeds as University lecturer, I worked as a post-doctoral research associate at the Department of Engineering Sciencee, University of Oxford. I currently hold a visiting fellow position at the University of Oxford. During my post-doc term there, I designed robust models for computer assisted endoscopy in gastroenterology, especially the oesophagus. The work resulted in several high-quality publication and two patents (filed/submitted). The project was a part of NIHR Oxford biomedical research centre imaging theme on Computer aided endoscopy for Barrett’s oesophagus, for which I worked in close collaboration with consultant gastroenterologists from the Oxford NHS University Hospitals, At Oxford, I am currently co-supervising two DPhil students. Previously, I also did a post doc at Biomedical and Computer vision group of Prof. Karl Rohr at the University of Heidelberg and DKFZ, Germany. During my work there I collaborated extensively with neuroscience researchers (led by Prof. Katrin Amunts) and physicists (led by Markus Axer) at Forschungszentrum, Jülich, Germany. I designed mathematically plausible phyics-based deformable multi-modal image registraiton techinque that allowed for precise 3D reconstruction of ultra high resolution (1.3um) 2D histology brain images between CCD acquired image and high-throughput polarized light microscopy (more info here). I have worked as researcher in different capacities in leading research teams in France, Spain, Germany, Switzerland and the UK.

6,Dr Abdulrahman Altahhan,"I have extesive experience in developing, leading and managing postgraduate and undergraduate computer science HE programmes, particularly in the areas of AI and Data Science. I am actively researching in the areas of Deep Reinforcement Learning, Neural Network and Machine Learning with hands-on applications and publications in image processing, autonomous vehicles and robotics. Autonomous learning from data is second nature to me; particularly I enjoy developing reinforcement learning algorithms, several of which have both a highly practical and theoretical potential. I have developed a tool that was adopted throughout a university for quantifying and accurately modeling the data from modules and course outcomes, these algorithms and research have a high potential for commercialisation. I have led a small research group in AI and Robotics along with a few programmes in Data Science, Intelligent Systems and Information Technology for both the undergraduate and graduate levels. I have taught numerous modules, the majority of which in AI and Machine Learning.  Programme Manager of ODL MSc in Artificial Intelligence  Experience Sep 2020 - Senior Teaching Fellow in Artificial Intelligence, University of Leeds, UK 2017 - 2020 Senior Lecturer in Computing Leeds Beckett University, UK 2014 - 2017 Programme Director MSc. Data Science Coventry University, UK 2011 - 2014 Assistant Professor and Acting Dean, American University(AUE), Dubai 2010 - 2011 Lecturer in Computer Science Yarmouk Private University, Syria 2005 - 2008 Visiting Lecturer University of Sunderland, UK 2004 - 2006 R&D Consultant ISS Group, University of Sunderland, UK My main research area is Deep Reinforcement Learning applied to Intelligent Agents. I have developed several novel RL and DRL algorithms that seamlessly integrate experience replay within the learning process of the agent. I have applied these on games, stochastic processes and on predicting control signals for a prosthetic limp. I have developed several robot navigation models that employed deep reinforcement learning to visually allow a robot to learn to navigate in an unknown environment without prior experience. Research  Deep Reinforcement Learning on Games This project aims at building a prototype of a reinforcement learning controller that uses deeply learned features of grabbed frames of a game as input. The agent will be trained to come up with the best control policy to win a game, whether playing against a human or another agent or even self-play! You will be using PyTorch along with an Attari simulator in Python to train your model to try and beat the performance of other models. Reinforcement Learning for Planning This project aims at building a reinforcement learning technique that is suitable for planning. The objective is to come up with a set of sub-goals to navigate in a simulated environment from one location to another without storing an explicit map of the environment. The planning behaviour would be explicit through interaction with the environment. Reinforcement Learning on Simulated Robot Homing This project aims at developing and training an agent controller that is equipped with reinforcement learning techniques to learn an optimal policy that allows the agent to go back to its home regardless of where it is. Particularly, when the goal is hidden. The idea is to mimic the ability of animals/ insects of reaching its home after foraging for food. This will be done using visual clues and the agent will be left to automatically learn to reach the home location with no map. The environment can be a simulated indoors or outdoors environment and you are free to choose its settings ( factory, flat etc). Visual Scene Identification using Deep Learning This project aims at creating and training a deep learning model that is effective in recognising a scene even when the angle is different than the one the model was initially exposed to. You will use a dataset that is created via a simulation or real scene images. Each image would have taken from a set of different angles and a fixed distance (or from an omnidirectional camera). The model should be trained to achieve high accuracy of identifying a scene from a reasonable distance and from different angles. Emotion Recognition using Deep Learning on a GPU This project aims at creating and training a deep learning model that is effective in recognising human emotion from different angles. You will use a readymade dataset of pictures taken for individuals expressing seven emotions - happy, sad, angry, neutral etc. Then the model should classify an image as expressing one of the aforementioned emotions. You will build the architecture using PyTorch or TensorFlow or any other deep learning framework and you will aim at deploying and training the model on a multi GPU server Gun Detection from a CCTV Feed using Deep Reinforcement Learning This project aims at creating and training a deep learning model that is effective in recognising a gun in the hand of a person in a CCTV setting. You will be using the YOLO framework with its ideas that stemmed from CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks), R-CNN, Fast R-CNN and Faster R-CNN. You would need to identify a suitable dataset other than the COCO dataset.   I am currently working on will be listed below.

He also reviews my draft papers and reports that the faculty is required me to submit. Eric has also been in contact to his students in regards to finding opportunities to grow as a researcher. Finally, he has never missed or cancelled any meetings throughout my journey which is something that tells me that he is with me along the way.” “Lecture content was interesting and well presented” “The teacher fully integrates his own research with the curriculum, and exercises the students' teamwork ability” “I have always enjoyed Eric is lectures because he seemed to genuinely want us to enjoy his module and learn from it. He also put effort in to reduce our stress and be able to actually enjoy the module and want to work for it, opposed to just pass a test.” “The content was interesting and the professor was really nice and enthusiastic” “really amiable lecturer, really easy to understand lecturer” “Nice that there is lots of hands-on/demonstration of material and approaches” “Enjoyed it as it provided a range of academic enlightenment in the field” “The teaching method was really impressive, professor also introduced some of the new research ongoing in this field.”  Artificial Intelligence  Menwa Alshammeri Shatha Altammami Taghreed Tarmom Lena Almutair Abdullah Alsaleh Moneerh Aleedy Ibtisam Alshammari Saud Althabiti Albatool Alamri Sarah Alnefaie Bashaer Alsafari Alaa Alsaqer Sanaa Alowaidi Salwa Alahmari Rawan Bin Shiha Amaal Alhejaily  We welcome enquiries from motivated and qualified applicants from all around the world who are interested in PhD study.

Procter and Gamble Sim Centre Manager Research Phase Field modelling of Intermetallics  My research activity is the modelling and simulation of micro structure formation in binary alloys. This avoids expensive molecular dynamic modelling by the use of macroscopic parameters: temperature, alloy concentration and phase. The latter is an order parameter that takes the value one if a particular phase of matter is present and zero if not. The challenge of the research is both the formulation of a thermodynamically consistent model and its implementation and simulation on computer. One difficulty at the modelling stage is the generic nature of the problem to cope with the seemingly infinite amount of possible alloy combinations. The problem is also inherently multiscale since, for example, the temperature field is typically 1000 times the size of the area of interest of the growing microstructure. To date a three dimensional simulations of this problem has not been achieved internationally despite wide availability of high performance computing facilities. With the combined resources of the School of Chemical and Process Engineering and the School of Computing department this problem is now successfully being addressed. The results are not only vital for macroscopic modelling in the casting industry, the simulation results give physical insight into processes that are difficult or impossible to view experimentally. Current research is on the simulation of intermetallic alloys, these are marked by very narrow ranges of possible concentration at the macroscale due to underlying molecular forces. The simulation of these materials is hampered by discontinuities in the energy as a function of alloy concentration which is highly non-linear and complex. I am part of the modelling contingent of the LIquid, Metal Engineering group (LIME), based in Brunel, Oxford, London, Manchester and Leeds. This was established to understand the properties of Alumium and its combination with other metals, notable, Iron. High grade pure Aluminium is currently very difficult to reclaim from alloy waste on an industrial scale. consequently huge energy and resources are currently employed to obtain Aluminium directly from the ground, whilst secondary Aluminium can only be recycled where quality is not critical. The aim of the project is to make the primary sourcing of aluminium redundant, by ultimately making recycling more cost effective. Aluminium - Iron alloys form Intermetallic compounds, which translates, on the macroscale as alloys with very narrow bands of possible alloy ratios. To model such alloys by extending current phase field modelling techniques is challenging both at the modelling level and of computational resources and methods. The phase field modelling is primarily being done in Leeds. Its motive being to gain a quantitative understanding of the Aluminium alloy solidification process in a variety of physical conditions. Such understanding should aid the construction of industrial processes to extract high grade Aluminium from industrial waste.   I am currently working on will be listed below.

30,Dr Mehmet Dogar,"I am an Associate Professor at the School of Computing, University of Leeds. I am an EPSRC Fellow and an Associate Editor for the International Journal of Robotics Research. Previously I acted as a co-chair of the IEEE RAS Technical Committee on Mobile Manipulation and an Associate Editor for IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters. Before joining Leeds, I was a postdoctoral researcher at CSAIL, MIT. I received my PhD from the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon University. Here is a talk I gave at UW-Seattle presenting an overview of my research interests:  My research focuses on autonomous robotic manipulation. I envision a future where robots autonomously perform complex manipulation tasks in human environments; such as grasping an object from the back of a cluttered shelf, or manufacturing and assemling a complex piece of furniture. My manipulation planners use physics-based predictive models. This challenges the existing paradigm which is based on a geometric representation of the world and is limited to pick-and-place actions. The physics-based approach, on the other hand, enables a robot to interact with the environment with a rich set of actions such as pushing, tumbling, and throwing, as well as pick-and-place. I am also interested in collaborative manipulation planning, where the task is performed through the collaboration of human-robot or robot-robot teams. Publications At the very bottom of this page is a list of my publications. Also see my Google Scholar page. Research Videos Tracking an object in clutter using a camera when a robot is manipulating it is particularly difficult, due to the cluttering objects and, inevitably, the robot hand blocking the view of the camera. In our recent work, we use robot controls information, during non-prehensile manipulation, to integrate physics-based predictions of the object motion with the camera view. The result is a smooth and consistent tracking of the object even under heavy occlusions (lead author: Zisong Xu). Arxiv version available here and this work is under review. We humans can easily pick multiple objects at a time, e.g, think of picking up multiple glasses simultaneously when clearing a dinner table. This is a difficult problem for robots, where they need to reason about how the multiple objects will move and interact with each during the pick. In collaboration with UC Berkeley, we developed a planner to pick multiple objects at a time. (This work was led by Wisdom Agboh, who was a PhD student in our group and is currently a visiting researcher at UC Berkeley.) Appeared at ISRR 2022 and the follow-up work is available on arxiv. Humans can provide valuable guidance for robot planning systems. Led by Rafael Papallas, in this series of works we developed human-in-the-loop planners that integrate high-level human guidance with robotic manipulation planning. We further investigated approaches where one single remote human operator can guide a cluster of robots (e.g., a cluster of robots working in a warehouse) to increase their efficiency and success rates. Appeared at RAL 2020 and IROS 2022. To search for a hidden object, a robot needs two skills: (1) generating hypotheses about where the hidden object may be, (2) manipulating the environment to reveal that part of the space to see if the searched object is there. Recently, a PhD student in our group, Wissam Bejjani (in collaboration with Matteo Leonetti), worked on training a neural network to simultaneously generate hypotheses about hidden object positions, while also learning action-value of the partially observable states. Below is the video of the system in action. In the video, at top right, you see the hypothesized positions of the target obect in green. Arxiv preprint here. Appeared at IROS 2021. We humans can predict the physical effects of our actions. For example, when you push an object with your finger, you have a prediction about how it will move. Robots need to make such predictions as well, to plan their actions. But what kind of a physics model shall robots use? The traditional approach in robotic planning is to use physics engines. There are other newer approaches to learning approximate physics models. In our recent work, we have been investigating methods to combine coarse but fast physics predictions, with accurate but slow physics predictions, to achieve accurate and fast predictions. Lead author Wisdom Agboh, in collaboration with Daniel Ruprecht. Arxiv preprints here, appeared at ISRR 2019. In our recent work, we have looked at learning policies for physics-based manipulation in clutter. Arxiv preprints here and here (appeared at Humanoid 2018 and IROS 2019, respectively). Lead author Wissam Bejjani, in collaboration with Matteo Leonetti. We have been developing algorithms for reactive re-planning for manipulation in cluttered environments. The planners that have been developed for this problem has been open-loop so far. The video below compares the performance of our closed-loop approach. Appeared at IEEE-RAS Humanoids 2018, arxiv preprint (lead author: Wisdom Agboh) here. Imagine reaching into a fridge shelf that is crowded with fragile objects, such as glass jars and containers. You move slowly and carefully. However, if the fridge shelf is almost empty, only with a few plastic containers that are difficult-to-break, you move faster with less care. In this work (lead author: Wisdom Agboh) we develop a model predictive control framework for robot pushing that adapts to the required task accuracy, pushing fast when it is okay, but slow when the robot needs to be more careful. Appeared at WAFR 2018, arxiv preprint here. Imagine grasping a wooden board while your friend drills holes into it and cuts pieces off of it. You would predict the forces your friend will apply on the board and choose your grasps accordingly; for example you would rest your palm firmly against the board to hold it stable against the large drilling forces. We developed (lead author: Lipeng Chen, appeared at IROS 2018) a manipulation planner to enable a robot grasp objects similarly. Arxiv preprint (2018) here. At MIT, we developed a multi-robot system to perform multi-step assembly tasks. The system can perform collaborative operations, e.g. two robots carrying a heavy part together. The system is also able to shift between coarse manipulation operations, such as transport, to fine operations, such as part alignment and fastener insert ignoreion. Read more about this study in our ISER 2014 paper. Our paper about multi-robot manipulation planning was a finalist for the Best Paper Award and the Best Manipulation Paper Award at ICRA 2015! A draft is available here. Tactile sensors provide contact information, essential for making physics-based predictions. In this work we use tactile sensing to localize objects during pushing actions. Human environments are cluttered and robots regularly need to solve manipulation problems by moving objects out of the way to reach other objects. The video below shows the PR2 using my push-grasp planner to contact multiple objects simultaneously and grasp objects through clutter: I developed an algorithm to rearrange clutter using a library of actions including pushing. The planner can move objects that are not movable by pick-and-place actions, e.g. large or heavy objects. Here is a video where HERB pushes a large box out of the way: You can see HERB executing push-grasps in the following video. Contrary to the instantaneous approach to grasping, I model grasping as a process where the object is pushed along by the hand before the fingers close on it. Push-grasping is robust to large uncertainties in object pose, because the uncertainty can be funneled into the hand during pushing. My work showed that we can pre-compute these funnels, called capture regions. Read more about this study in our IROS 2010 paper. Here is a demo our lab at CMU put together where our robot HERB microwaves a meal:    I am currently working on will be listed below.

I used to run 3 networks at the University of Leeds which were RSE Leeds, Women in HPC Leeds and Visualisation. During lockdown, there was a switch to online, making them cheaper to run. Many of these activities have remained online, and the number of activities have increased and are run by a variety of organisations. I did not have admistrative support to run these groups so it was no longer sensible to run these networks.  I am developing software for 7 imaging case studies, across 3 imaging modalities and across disciplines. I am partnered with Diamond Light Source (DLS) a national synchrotron facility, SuperSTEM an EPSRC national research facility for Advanced Electron Microscopy and the SCI (Scientific Computing and Imaging) Institute in Utah, USA. The case studies that I am working on with Sven Schroeder use the DLS facilities and a type of spectroscopy called XANES (X-ray Absorption Near Edge Spectroscopy). These are: Multi-phase and multi-component products; tomography of impurity and additive distributions in organic and inorganic crystals; imaging of the early stages of wear on orthopedic implants; and in situ fluid flow of in devices. The case studies I am working on with Rik Drummond-Bryson use the SuperSTEM facilities and are: Nanostructure advanced alloys, compositor and surface engineered materials; functional thin fils and devices; and chemical catalysis. I am also working on a case study with Michelle Peckham using her super high resolution light microscope and is: Muti-dimensional imaging and cross-correlation methods. I have also worked with a sociologist, ethnographer and an expert in the social contruction of science, Wes Sharrock, since 2001 while working on my PhD.

My research interest is in robotic manipulation, manipulation planning, motion planning and motion control. Publications At the very bottom, there is a list of my publications. They are also available on my Google Scholar website here.  I envision a future where robots co-exist with humans in dynamic environments to empower and improve the quality of their lives. For example, consider a robot at home assisting a motor-impaired person with daily tasks like the one in the figure below. The robot needs to retrieve the orange juice bottle from the back of a cluttered fridge. Other obstacles, at the front of the fridge, prevent the robot from directly reaching and grasping the orange juice bottle successfully. The robot needs to find a plan to manipulate those objects, perhaps by safely pushing them away, to create the required space to reach and grasp the orange juice bottle. My research deals with such challenging problems where a robot needs to interact with movable objects in cluttered and dynamic environments while reasoning about their dynamics. In particular, I am interested in developing motion planning and control algorithms for non-prehensile physics-based manipulation in clutter. This is a particularly challenging problem today in Robotics. We don’t have robots that can achieve such manipulation effectively in highly cluttered environments like a fridge or a warehouse shelf.   I am currently working on will be listed below.

Evangelos' research interest focus on distributed and intelligent social computing systems with expertise in the inter-disciplinary application domains of Smart Cities and Smart Grids.  My research focuses on the self-management of decentralized networked systems designed to empower citizens’ participation for a more democratic and sustainable digital society. Designing decentralized and self-managed techno-socio-economic systems that can continuously self-adapt, self-heal, self-repair, self-organize and ultimately self-regulate the production and consumption of our resources, e.g. energy, food supplies, sharing vehicles, etc., are means for a sustainable development as I show in my research. Supply-demand data sharing systems self-regulated via differential privacy mechanisms and distributed ledger systems, i.e. blockchain, can protect citizens’ privacy, while incentivizing a fair data sharing for a high quality of service. System-wide, citizens’ active participation and autonomy raises communication and computational challenges: Data streams need to propagate rapidly and regularly in a distributed network. Citizens’ collective choices often have combinatorial complexity. Decentralized optimization and collective learning over crowd-sourced computational resources of citizens is the main challenge of my research. Tackling this challenge can have a tremendous impact on a new generation of artificial intelligence for socio-technical systems equipped with socially responsible self-management capabilities applied on emerging application domains of Smart Grids, Smart Cities and their sharing economies.   I am currently working on will be listed below.

74,Dr Arash Rabbani,"In 2010, I was still an undergraduate student when I ran into the concept of digital image processing. It started as a hobby, but soon became my main focus when I began to work as a researcher. Coming from an engineering background, I started using 3-D images to tackle fluid flow problems in porous materials. You may know that almost every live or lifeless body of mass is porous at some level since more than 99.99% of the universe is an empty space. However, there is almost always a fluid residing or moving through the void spaces of a porous material. To get a better understanding of this fascinating natural phenomenon, Data Flow Lab is founded at the University of Leeds. Data Flow Lab focuses on computationally efficient data-driven solutions for fluid flow problems in micro-structured porous material from subsurface water and sustainable energy resources to the amazing world of living cells and tissues.

87,Dr John Stell,"I studied Mathematics and later Computer Science at the University of Manchester. I worked at Keele University both in Mathematics and in Computer Science. I came to Leeds in 2001 as a Lecturer and have been Senior Lecturer since 2003. While working at Leeds I studied Fine Art part time at Leeds College of Art, graduating with a first class degree in 2010. I have used this interdisciplinary background to combine research in Computer Science with work on spatial concepts in the digital humanities.  Programme Director, Computer Science, SWJTU-Leeds Joint School  My research interests lie in the area of qualitative spatial representation and reasoning. Particular current concerns include models of spatial information at multiple levels of detail and discrete models of space. This involves the application to mathematical logic to the representation of spatial knowledge. I also work with in interdisciplinary collaborations to connect the use of spatial concepts in the digital humanities with approaches to space in computer science. I am a Turing Fellow (2021-22) and I am a member of two interest groups at the Alan Turing Institute: AI and Arts and Humanities and Data Science. In logic, a continuing programme of work uses bi-intuitionistic modal logic in the study of graphs at different levels of detail in knowledge representation. In 2019 the International Journal of Humanities and Arts Computing published a Special Section on Qualitative Spatial Representation containing reports from my AHRC Research Network on Space and Narrative in the Digital Humanities. This project (2018-2019) was in collaboration with Ian Gregory at Lancaster University. In the humanities spatial data is often fundamentally vague, uncertain, or metaphorical, but conventional Geographical Information Systems (GIS) are limited in their ability to repesent this type of data in ways that are useful for humanities scholars. The project investigated for the first time how qualitative spatial representation and other related methods can be used as novel ways of handling the kind of spatial data that is important in the humanities but which does not fit with existing GIS technology. I am currently working (2021-22) on an interdisciplinary project funded by the Leeds Humanities Research Institute. This project, “Space on the Page”, explores spatial representation in the context of visual poetry and other kinds of text where spatial arrangement of words and letters is a key part of meaning.    I am currently working on will be listed below.

98,Professor Jie Xu,"I am the leader for a Research Peak of Excellence at Leeds, the director of the EPSRC-funded White Rose Grid e-Science Centre, involving the three White Rose Universities of Leeds, Sheffield and York, and the head of the Distributed Systems and Services (DSS) Theme (with a total of over 40 theme members) at Leeds. I have worked in the field of Distributed Computing Systems for over thirty-five years, engaging closely with industrial leaders such as Rolls-Royce, BAE Systems, and JLR. I received a PhD in Computing Science from the University of Newcastle upon Tyne, and was Professor of Distributed Systems at the University of Durham (https://www.dur.ac.uk/) before joined Leeds in 2003. I am an executive member of UKCRC (UK Computing Research Committee) and a Turing Fellow in AI and Data Science. I have served as an academic expert for numerous governments and industries, such as Singapore IDA, Lenovo, UK EPSRC, and UK DTI (InnovateUK). In addition, I have extensive editorial experience, having served as an editor for IEEE Distributed Systems from 2000 to 2005, and currently acting as an associate editor of IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems and ACM Computing Surveys. I am a Steering Committee member for several prestigious IEEE conferences, such as SRDS, ISORC, HASE, SOSE, JCC, and CISOSE, as well as serving on the executive board of IEEE TC on BIS. I have also been a General Chair/PC Chair for various IEEE international conferences. With over 300 academic publications, including papers in top-ranked IEEE and ACM Transactions, I have received international research prizes, such as the BCS/AT&T Brendan Murphy Prize, and led or co-led more than 20 research projects worth over £25M. I am also the co-founder of two university spin-outs that specialize in data analytics and AI software for optimizing data center performance and in co-simulation and digital twins. The EPSRC-funded WRG e-Science centre (2002-2014), led by me, is a highly successful and internationally leading e-Research centre. It represents a strategic partnership between the three major Yorkshire research universities - Leeds, Sheffield and York - which has added significant value to their research projects in the areas of Internet-Based Computing and Advanced Engineering Applications (e.g. a highly successful partnership with Rolls-Royce), raising the national and international profile of the universities. From an initial investment of £7 million from the three universities, the centre has gone on to generate research income from both research councils and industry worth more than £20 million over the next 10 years. I am now leading a collaborative research team, investigating fundamental theories and models for distributed systems (e.g. the theory for fault-diagnosable and large-scale distributed systems, and the formalisation for dynamic multi-party authentication) and developing advanced Internet and Cloud technologies with a focus on complex system engineering (e.g. with Rolls-Royce and JLR), energy-efficient computing (e.g. with Google and Alibaba), dependable and secure collaboration (e.g. large-scale data processing and analysis for social science and e-healthcare applications with TPP and X-Lab Ltd), and evolving system architectures (e.g. with BAE Systems).  Head of Distributed Systems and Services Theme  My main research interests are on massive-scale distributed computing systems, complex resource management for Edge-Cloud computing, and data-centric system engineering, focusing on investigating, designing and implementing system components and mechanisms to tackle performance, efficiency, dependability and cost-effectiveness challengies and manage their trade-offs. I am also working on system and software dependability, including software fault tolerance, and rapid error recovery in Cloud data centres.

99,Dr Omer Yuval,"The neurons that control living organisms are incredibly complex machines. Despite popular analogies to artificial neural networks, biological neurons show a great variety of dynamics across species, throughout the network, as well as across time-scales and contexts within the same neuron. To name a few, spiking, graded responses, multi-stability, desensitisation, synchronisation, rebound and phase-resetting. However, the importance of these mechanisms for information encoding and animal behaviour remains unclear. Biological neural networks were fine tuned and optimised through an evolutionary process within a wide range of temporal and spatial scales (e.g., subcellular, cellular and network level) for controlling a physical body that operates within a physical environment. Hence, neurons do not function in isolation, and their dynamics are modulated by a variety of sensory stimuli, such as chemosensation and proprioception. While increasingly larger connectomes are being mapped, single-neuron- and network-dynamics are still largely missing. Understanding the importance of these dynamics has far-reaching implications both for understanding human and animal behaviour, and for developing artificial systems that can interact with the real world. I am interested in the dynamics and patterns generated by individual neurons and small neural networks (typically up to 10) and how they operate in their natural context across a range of time scales. I combine experimental techniques, computational tools and mathematical modelling to develop biologically-grounded models that capture fundamental phenomena in the brain. These can be used to characterise and make testable predictions regarding information encoding and animal behaviour, as well as implicated in artificial systems.   I am currently working on will be listed below.

100,Dr Arezoo Zakeri,"Dr Arezoo Zakeri received her BSc in Electrical Engineering from Shahid Bahonar University of Kerman, Iran. In 2009, she moved to Tehran to start MSc in Biomedical Engineering at Iran University of Science and Technology with Dr Abbas Erfanian Omidvar. She worked on HRV signals using adaptive optimal kernel time-frequency analysis in ischemic subjects. Arezoo continued her educations for PhD at Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran, in 2011. She worked with Dr Mohammad Hossein Miran Baygi on the optical characterization of biological tissues and pigmented skin lesions. In her PhD thesis, she designed and manufactured a prototype semi-automated Mueller matrix imaging system to acquire polarization image maps of tissue samples and developed models for interpretation of polarization properties in turbid media. She has been working as a faculty member of Biomedical Engineering at Islamic Azad University since 2012. In 2019 she joined the Centre for Computational Imaging and Simulation Technologies in Biomedicine (CISTIB) at the University of Leeds as a postdoc research fellow. She developed deep generative models for probabilistic cardiac motion modelling and abnormal shape detection. In 2021, Arezoo joined RadNet to start working with Dr Zeike Taylor. Her current work is developing spatiotemporal models of breathing motion from 4D-CT data and motion-compensated image reconstruction of internal anatomy.
