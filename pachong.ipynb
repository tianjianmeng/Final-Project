    "Student feedback:\n",
    "“He is a fantastic lecturer who has made the semester significantly more enjoyable with his live lectures. With two semesters which were otherwise ruined by covid-19, COMP2121 was genuinely enjoyable to watch. Plus he has a lovely kitten which made some guest appearances in lecture, which alone should qualify him for an award.”\n",
    "“i love the commitment and enthusiasm of the module leader Eric Atwell”\n",
    "“The module leader was lovely and so was his kitten. The coursework was interesting and the group work was helpful. There were a lot of learning materials provided”\n",
    "“He has been really supportive and understanding  during this unprecedented time. Also he helps his students develop other soft skills in addition to their intellectual development.”\n",
    "“The content was interesting and the lecturer was engaged with the topic”\n",
    "“I highly recommend this course. The class content of this course is rich, and the teaching methods are diversified, which can well apply the theory to practice”\n",
    "“He is supportive and encourage me every step of the way”\n",
    "“I learnt a lot from you, many thanks for your regular excellent supervision, caring, and the considerable advices you provided to me, patiently listened to me in meetings, and gave me the best suggestions. Thank you for your endless help, support and guidance.”\n",
    "“Liked the videos Eric would play before the lecture started on Friday mornings!”\n",
    "“Eric has made me feel like I am attending lectures to learn and not just to pass an exam. When other areas of our course have got tough he has postponed exams and tried to make them as doable as possible for his students. He also makes regular contact with his students and is good at what he does.”\n",
    "“I thought that the content taught in the module was interesting and engaging, and we were provided with lots of supplementary papers and resources to support our learning”\n",
    "“Thank you, because you had been a great master for me. A teacher who does not tire of my questions, Support when facing problems, and full of patience.”\n",
    "“Professor Eric is very cooperative with his students and is always available to assist them and answer their inquiries. He always tries to involve them in research groups and reading groups to expand their knowledge. Also, he is committed to time and meeting schedules.”\n",
    "“Eric is very clearly passionate about the subject, and that's something that always shines through to students. He's an engaging teacher and is more than happy to help with any questions”\n",
    "“Liked that the module contained a high percentage of coursework content (rather than just exams).”\n",
    "“Eric Atwell has been very supportive of my PhD studies since the start of my journey. He pushed me to read papers and experiment with models, and then publish papers once I successfully finish with experiments. He also reviews my draft papers and reports that the faculty is required me to submit. Eric has also been in contact to his students in regards to finding opportunities to grow as a researcher. Finally, he has never missed or cancelled any meetings throughout my journey which is something that tells me that he is with me along the way.”\n",
    "“Lecture content was interesting and well presented”\n",
    "“The teacher fully integrates his own research with the curriculum, and exercises the students' teamwork ability”\n",
    "“I've always enjoyed Eric's lectures because he seemed to genuinely want us to enjoy his module and learn from it. He also put effort in to reduce our stress and be able to actually enjoy the module and want to work for it, opposed to just pass a test.”\n",
    "“The content was interesting and the professor was really nice and enthusiastic”\n",
    "“really amiable lecturer, really easy to understand lecturer”\n",
    "“Nice that there's lots of hands-on/demonstration of material and approaches”\n",
    "“Enjoyed it as it provided a range of academic enlightenment in the field”\n",

ConceptNet Numberbatch is part of the ConceptNet open data project. ConceptNet provides lots of ways to compute with word meanings, one of which is word embeddings. ConceptNet Numberbatch is a snapshot of just the word embeddings. It is built using an ensemble that combines data from ConceptNet, word2vec, GloVe, and OpenSubtitles 2016, using a variation on retrofitting.', 'read_more': ['http://aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI17/paper/view/14972', 'https://github.com/commonsense/conceptnet-numberbatch', 'http://conceptnet.io/'], 'checksum': 'fd642d457adcd0ea94da0cd21b150847', 'file_name': 'conceptnet-numberbatch-17-06-300.gz', 'parts': 1}, 'word2vec-ruscorpora-300': {'num_records': 184973, 'file_size': 208427381, 'base_dataset': 'Russian National Corpus (about 250M words)', 'reader_code': 'https://github.com/RaRe-Technologies/gensim-data/releases/download/word2vec-ruscorpora-300/__init__.py', 'license': 'https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/deed.en', 'parameters': {'dimension': 300, 'window_size': 10}, 'description': 'Word2vec Continuous Skipgram vectors trained on full Russian National Corpus (about 250M words).
